## 📊 **Performance Improvements**

### **Pipeline Efficiency**
- **Parallel Execution**: Jobs run in parallel where possible
- **Caching**: Docker layer caching and dependency caching
- **Selective Testing**: Performance tests only on main branch
- **Optimized Images**: Multi-stage builds for production images

### **Deployment Speed**
- **Blue-Green Strategy**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Health Checks**: Fast failure detection
- **Rollback Speed**: Quick rollback capabilities (< 5 minutes)

## 🔧 **Configuration Requirements**

### **GitHub Secrets Required**
```bash
# Production Environment
PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL
PRODUCTION_SECRET_KEY
PRODUCTION_REDIS_URL
PRODUCTION_CORS_ORIGINS
PRODUCTION_ALLOWED_HOSTS

# Staging Environment
STAGING_DATABASE_URL
STAGING_SECRET_KEY
STAGING_REDIS_URL
